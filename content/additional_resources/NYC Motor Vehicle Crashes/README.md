The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event.
Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables
contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.
The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where
someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage
([Source as pdf](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf)). It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to
change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For
the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to
the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page (updated weekly) or Vision Zero View
(updated monthly).

Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the
CompStat principles to other problems. Other than homicides, the fatal
incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal
traffic collisions. Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented
TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic
safety. Police officers complete form MV-104AN for all vehicle collisions. The
MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic
collision. Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety
data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts. Therefore, the Police
Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July
1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City. TAMS
required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect
very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of
accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need
for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted.
The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.
Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data
in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic
fatalities. Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the
new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS). FORMS enables the police
officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all
of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the
Department’s crime data warehouse. Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are
now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be
conducted as applicable.
